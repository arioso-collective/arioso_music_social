I've added screenshots of the different "schemas" of the collections in our cloud database.
MongoDB does not use strict schemas, which is why it is so flexible, but the following validation actions
act as a way to prevent the user from entering information for fields that is invalid. These are just 
the collections that we currently need, and the backend team will continue to add more collections and
fields as needed by the frontend team.
