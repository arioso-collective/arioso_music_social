1. Research MongoDB Database and MongoDB Atlas
2. I am researching MongoDb and MongoDB Atlas to use a cloud database for our project, as it more horizontally scalable. Additionally, a No SQL database will better fit our needs as we grow and add more functionality to our application.
3. I expect to learn the basics of MongoDB, and how to create a MongoDB Cluster and Database, and connect this to our project.
4. Once I have determined how to set up our database, I will use this information to create new collections for the different types of data we intend on storing. From here, this will be used to create a Flask backend API to make changes to our database.
5. I need this research to perform all tasks for the Dynamic Database User Story, and the database must be created before we can begin developing an API for it.

Notes: It was very simple to set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster and start the connection.
