1. Test Password Hashing (hash_password) and Compare Password (compare_password) functions. 
-Test that password is successfully hashed, and that it does not equal the plain_text_password after hashing.
-Test that the same password hashed twice returns a unique hash. (The same password hashed twice should result in unique hashes)
-Test compare password when passwords match (Should return True).
-Test compare password when passwords do not match (Should return False).

2. Test Create User (create_user) method to ensure user information is successfully sent to the database.
This test will use MongoMock to set up a mock database to test the create_user function without actually using the React frontend or making any changes to our database as it is.
It will pass a pseudo user document to the database and then confirm that the information is actually found in the database.
-Test create user to ensure it requires all fields/handles missing fields.
-Test create user to ensure it does not allow duplicate usernames.
-Test create user to ensure it does not allow duplicate emails.
-Test user creation and confirm it returns a json response.
