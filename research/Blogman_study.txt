"GitHub : https://github.com/swarina/Blogman"

I was messing with this GitHub repo called blogman. 
It has a log in and sign up page that have a #nice set up. I wanted to reuse the blog set up that is implemented for our sites comment section. 
It has a nice set up of having a main topic and subset topics. 

I was able to get the site running
ISSUE FIXES FOR RUNNING
python manage.py runserver
make sure that bootstraps4 is running on the settings.python
This works with Danjo as the back end so I will have to look more into that as well.
