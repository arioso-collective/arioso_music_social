How to connect Flask Backend and React Front end


We will be figuring out how to do API calls on flask that will interact with our react 
front end. We are trying to see how we should format both ends so they can connect smoothly once
the database and API calls are set up.

Trying to understand exactly how they interact and to what extend each software is used. 
Also trying to see how other sites did simple API calls and use user input to transfer 
We want to make sure that while both ends are worked on seperately we know what part of the front end to format the backend
to when we set up flaskbackend to make API calls
After making the tabels we will use this information to ensure that the flask backend is collecting the correct data 
and that the react front end can recieve this information such as music and image options

Quick sum:
In react: In general what proxy does is, when we request into the javascript web server which serves the react frontend will 
automatically be redirected to the proxy key. In this case, it will be our flask server. 
For fetching the API useState and useEffect hooks are used in react app.
