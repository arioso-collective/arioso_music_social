React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook for building fast and interactive user interfaces. It promotes the concept of reusable components, which encapsulate their own state and structure, making complex UIs manageable.

When it comes to website deployment, a typical React workflow is as follows:

1. Develop the application using JSX and components.
2. Use tools like Create React App to compile and bundle the code.
3. Generate a production build, which optimizes and outputs static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
4. Host these static files on a web server or deploy them using a CDN for fast global access.

This approach leverages the Virtual DOM for efficient updates and ensures that the final build is optimized for performance and scalability.

Notes:
- React page consists of components
- Uses Javascript or typescript
- "App" react page is the root of the application, compnents are combined to make up entire react pages
