1. Research Database Schema and Relationships
2. I am researching Database Schema and Relationships to better organize our project's database file.
3. I expect to learn the different types of relationships present in databases and between tables within databases. This will assist me in the "Database Connection" Jira task.
4. Once I have determined the different types of relationships present in databases, I will use this information to rewrite the Database file to include new organizational tables and create new Databases to securely store different types of user data.
5. The biggest task that this research is for is the Database Connection task.
