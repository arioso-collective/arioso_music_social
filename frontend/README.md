# Frontend Development Server Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the React development server for our project.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

The development server will automatically reload if you make changes to the source files.
